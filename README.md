This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Scentronix Recipes App
##### And my first Nextjs app also!

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Demo

Only Recipes list and Recipe detail page are implemented. Other pages contain simple text only.
